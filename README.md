# BooKLooking

    
## [Description](#description)
    
This app is emblematic of the fact that most modern websites are driven by two things: data and user demands. This shouldn't come as a surprise, as the ability to personalize user data is the cornerstone of real-world web development today. And as user demands evolve, applications need to be more performant.
    
### Motivation
    
This app is emblematic of the fact that most modern websites are driven by two things: data and user demands. This shouldn't come as a surprise, as the ability to personalize user data is the cornerstone of real-world web development today. And as user demands evolve, applications need to be more performant.
    
### Problems Solved 
    
One of the big problems at the moment is the fact that you cant login as a previous user but you can signup and you'll be loged in that way. I am currently trying to fix the issue. I'm not sure where the source of the problem is. 
    
### What I learned 
    
I have learned how to use graphql in a full stack app in place of a REST-API
